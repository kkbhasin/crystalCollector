# Crystal Collector

This is as much a math game as it is a memory game. You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by exactly matching your total score to the randomly generated number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the randomly generated number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time when the game starts, the game will change the value of each crystal.
